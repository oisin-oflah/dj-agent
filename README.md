# DJ Music Discovery & Set Planning Tool

An intelligent tool that helps DJs discover new tracks, analyze music compatibility, and plan cohesive sets by combining music streaming APIs, audio analysis, and DJ workflow optimization.

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
DJs spend countless hours searching for new tracks that fit their style, analyzing BPM and key compatibility, and planning seamless set progressions. Current tools are scattered across multiple platforms and don't provide integrated workflow from discovery to set planning.
